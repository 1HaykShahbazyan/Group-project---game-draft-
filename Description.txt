Fantasy Arena is a Java-based simulation of strategic battles inspired by popular digital card games. It encompasses several key classes and components that work together to create an immersive gameplay experience.

The Game class serves as the core engine, managing gameplay flow and interactions between players and champions. Methods like changeTurn() and useSkill() control turn-based actions, while removeFallenChampions() handles defeated champions. The constructor ensures fair matchups and throws exceptions like InvalidCharacterChoiceException and UnfairMatchupException when necessary.

Players are represented by the Player class, which encapsulates player information and their chosen champions. Champion classes, extending the abstract Champion class and implementing the Attack interface, define combat roles and abilities. Attributes like health and mana are managed dynamically during battles.

The Attack interface standardizes combat mechanics, providing methods for dealing physical and magical damage. GameConsole acts as the user interface, allowing players to interact with the game environment by selecting characters and executing skills.

The LevelDatabase offers various battlegrounds, managing information about different levels and champion configurations. Players can choose their preferred battlefield for combat.

Overall, Fantasy Arena offers an immersive and strategic gaming experience, from selecting champions to engaging in intense battles. With its dynamic gameplay and variety of levels, it promises hours of excitement and challenge for players.
